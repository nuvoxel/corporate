**Last updated: {{Date}}**

## 1. Acceptance
By accessing or using any content on www.nuvoxel.com (or associated sub-domains) — including marketing site, blogs, documentation, whitepapers, landing pages — you agree to be bound by these Terms of Use. If you do not agree, do not access or use the site.

## 2. Content & Intellectual Property
All content on the site — text, images, logos, graphics, design, layout — is the property of NuVoxel (or its licensors). You may view, download (for viewing only), or print the content for your personal, non-commercial use. You may not reproduce, distribute, modify, publicly display or create derivative works, or otherwise exploit our content without our express prior written consent.

## 3. No Warranties; Accuracy of Information
The content on the public site is provided for informational and marketing purposes only. While we strive for accuracy (product descriptions, pricing, feature lists, compatibility), we do not guarantee that the information is complete, current, or error-free. Features, pricing, availability, third-party integrations, compliance, or other aspects may change without notice.

You should not rely solely on site content for making business decisions — always contact us (sales or support) for binding info, quotes, or commitments.

## 4. Limitation of Liability
To the fullest extent permitted by law, NuVoxel and its affiliates are not liable for any direct or indirect damages arising out of your use of (or inability to use) the site, or reliance on its content, even if advised of the possibility of such damages.

## 5. Links to Third-Party Sites
Our site may contain links to external third-party websites, integrations, partner resources, or references. We do not control those external sites, and are not responsible for their content, practices, or privacy policies. Visiting such sites is at your own risk.

## 6. Changes to Terms
We may modify these Terms of Use at any time by updating the content here. Your continued use of the public site after such changes constitutes acceptance of the updated terms.

## 7. Governing Law
These Terms are governed by the laws of the State of California (or other jurisdiction you designate), without regard to conflict-of-law principles.
