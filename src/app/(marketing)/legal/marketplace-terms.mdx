# Additional Marketplace Terms

**Last updated: {{Date}}**

These additional terms apply when you subscribe to, purchase, or deploy the Hydrogen Cloud Intelligence Service through a third-party marketplace, such as the Microsoft Azure Marketplace, AWS Marketplace, or a Cloud Solution Provider (CSP) program (“Marketplace”).

## 1. Marketplace Provisioning & Billing
When subscribing via a Marketplace, Customer acknowledges that billing, invoicing, and payment may be handled by the Marketplace operator (or its intermediary), subject to the Marketplace’s billing terms. NuVoxel remains the service provider; but payment collection, invoicing, and refund policies may defer to the Marketplace agreement.

NuVoxel may need to collect or verify certain information required by the Marketplace (e.g. Azure subscription ID, Tenant ID, Marketplace metadata) for deployment or entitlement.

## 2. Deployment & Licensing Model
Hydrogen may be offered as a managed SaaS, container-app, or deployable managed app via the Marketplace. The license granted is as per the base TOS/EULA, but usage is additionally governed by the Marketplace’s technical requirements (e.g. cloud provider credentials, region restrictions, resource quotas, entitlement checks).

Customer is responsible for complying with the underlying cloud provider’s terms of use, resource usage policies, security, compliance, and any regulatory or geographic constraints.

## 3. Data Processing & Compliance
If Customer deploys Hydrogen via a Marketplace-managed app, NuVoxel (or its authorized subprocessors) may process Customer Data within the cloud provider environment as described in our main Privacy Policy and Data Processing Addendum (DPA).

Customer retains ownership of Customer Data; NuVoxel acts as a data processor / service provider under the terms of the DPA.

## 4. Marketplace-Specific Liability & Support
NuVoxel’s liability and warranty disclaimers remain as in the main TOS/EULA.

Marketplace deployment-support (e.g. resource provisioning, cloud infrastructure issues) may involve third-party support (cloud provider, Marketplace operator), and NuVoxel cannot guarantee uptime, availability, or compliance on third-party infrastructure beyond reasonable efforts.

Customer support, feature requests, or service-level commitments remain per NuVoxel’s standard support or enterprise agreement; Marketplace listing does not guarantee any additional SLA beyond what’s documented in the plan.

## 5. Audit, Compliance, and Termination Rights
NuVoxel reserves the right to suspend or terminate access if Customer violates cloud provider or Marketplace terms, fails entitlement checks, or breaches this Agreement.

Upon termination, Customer Data and entitlements may be revoked or disabled, subject to data retention or deletion policies.

## 6. Marketplace-Provided Disclaimers & Customer Notices
Customer acknowledges that by accepting these terms, they also are subject to the Marketplace’s own Terms of Use, Privacy Policy, License Agreement, or other rules.

NuVoxel may update this Marketplace-Variant at any time; material changes will be communicated to users via the Marketplace or direct notice.
