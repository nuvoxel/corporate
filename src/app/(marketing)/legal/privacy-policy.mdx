## 1. Data We Collect

We may collect and process the following categories of information:

- **Billing & Payment Data**: billing address, invoice information, payment method details (as required by our payment provider), purchase history, subscription plan, usage tiers.
- **Customer Data & Configuration**: any data, metadata, credentials, configuration, or cloud account information you supply through the Service (e.g. Azure subscription IDs, resource metadata, usage metrics), to enable analysis/insights.
- **Communications & Support**: any messages, feedback, bug reports, or support requests you submit.

### b. Automatically collected information

- **Cookies, Web Beacons, Tracking**: cookies, local storage, tracking pixels, analytics scripts — for site use, analytics, performance, and optional marketing (if consented).

### c. Data from third parties and integrations

If you connect cloud providers (e.g. Azure, AWS, GCP) or other third-party services to Hydrogen, we may receive metadata, usage data, configuration info, and other resource data from those services (subject to your consent and permissions).

## 2. How & Why We Collect and Use Your Data

We use your data for the following purposes:

- **Provide and maintain the Service** — enabling account creation, authentication, billing, access control, dashboard generation, analytics, integrations, and insight delivery.
- **Process transactions & billing** — manage subscription plans, usage tracking, invoicing, payment processing, renewals, and access rights associated with your Order.
- **Support & communications** — respond to support requests, communicate important Service notices, updates, changes, and send technical or administrative messages.
- **Service improvement & analytics** — analyze usage patterns, performance, feature adoption, troubleshoot bugs, optimize user experience, and build aggregated usage statistics.
- **Security, fraud prevention & compliance** — protect the Service, detect unauthorized access or abuse, comply with laws, and address security incidents.
- **Research, development & anonymized analytics** — with any personal identifiers removed or anonymized, we may use aggregate/anonymous data to improve our AI models, analytics engine, and overall Service capabilities.

## 3. Disclosure and Sharing of Information

We may share your data (as described above) with:

- **Service providers and partners** — hosting providers, cloud infrastructure vendors, payment processors, analytics providers, email/CRM/marketing providers, support vendors, and other third-party tools used to deliver the Service.
- **Third-party integrations you enable** — if you connect your own cloud account or third-party services, data from them may be processed by us to provide features or insights.
- **Our affiliates, subsidiaries, or business successors** — e.g., in connection with a merger, acquisition, sale, or reorganization.
- **Legal and compliance purposes** — when required by law, regulation, subpoena, or government request; or to protect rights, safety, security, or property of NuVoxel, its users, or the public.
- **Consent-based sharing** — if you explicitly consent to additional sharing (e.g. for marketing, research, benchmarking).

**Important**: We do not sell, rent, or trade your personal information to third parties for monetary or other valuable consideration.

## 4. Data Retention & Deletion

We retain personal data and Customer Data for as long as needed to provide the Service, fulfill contractual obligations (billing, support, compliance), and for a reasonable period after account termination in case of disputes, audits, or legal obligations.

Upon your request (or if required by law), and subject to any legitimate retention needs (e.g., billing records, legal compliance), we will securely delete personal data and Customer Data.

For deletion requests or questions, contact us at privacy@nuvoxel.com (or the email/contact specified in our contact section).

## 5. Data Subject Rights & Privacy Controls

Depending on your jurisdiction (e.g. California, EU, etc.), you may have rights regarding your personal data. These may include:

- **Access**: request a copy of your personal data.
- **Rectification**: correct inaccurate or incomplete data.
- **Erasure (“right to be forgotten”)**: request deletion of personal data.
- **Restriction of processing or objection**: under certain conditions.
- **Data portability**: receive your personal data in a structured, machine-readable format.
- **Withdraw consent** (where consent was the basis) or opt-out of non-essential processing (e.g. marketing, optional tracking).

If you wish to exercise any of these rights, contact us at privacy@nuvoxel.com or through the contact info on our site.

## 6. Security & Protection Measures

We implement commercially reasonable technical, administrative, and physical safeguards to protect your data — including encryption (in transit and at rest where applicable), access controls, secure authentication, regular audits, and incident response procedures. However, no system can guarantee 100% security; you acknowledge and accept this inherent risk.

## 7. Children’s Privacy

Our Service is not directed to children under 18. We do not knowingly collect personal information from minors. If we become aware that personal data of a child under 18 has been collected, we will take steps to delete the data promptly.

## 8. International Data Transfers

If you use our Service from a jurisdiction different than ours, your data may be transferred to and processed in the United States (or other hosting locations) or by third-party service providers located elsewhere. By using the Service, you consent to such transfers, storage, and processing across borders, subject to applicable law and safeguards.

## 9. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy periodically (e.g. when we add features, integrations, or comply with new regulations). When we do, we will publish the revised version with a new “Last updated” date. For material changes, we will notify you (e.g. via email or site banner). Continued use after changes constitutes acceptance.
